- `dephash ./path/to/file --npm --dev`
- `dephash ./path/to/file --yarn`

#### `dind`

Canonical Tag: `dind-<DOCKER_VERSION>` \
Latest URL: `govtechsg/cicd-images:dind-latest`

## Other Uses

Images specified here can be uploaded to other repositories if you so wish. The commands are:

### For Building

The build script creates the build for the specified image:

```bash
DH_REPO=__URL_TO_REPO__
IMAGE_NAME=__DIRECTORY_NAME__
./.scripts/.build.sh "${DH_REPO}" "${IMAGE_NAME}"
```

An example to upload to a DockerHub at `yourusername/yourimage:dind-latest`:

```bash
DH_REPO="yourusername/yourimage"
IMAGE_NAME="dind"
./.scripts/.build.sh "${DH_REPO}" "${IMAGE_NAME}"
```

### For Publishing

The publish script in each directory sends your built image to DockerHub and relies on the `./.scripts/.build.sh` script being run prior to it. The general format of usage:

```bash
DH_REPO=__URL_TO_REPO__
IMAGE_NAME=__DIRECTORY_NAME__
./${IMAGE_NAME}/.publish.sh "${DH_REPO}:${IMAGE_NAME}"
```

A corresponding example to upload to a DockerHub repository at `yourusername/yourimage:dind-latest`:

```bash
DH_REPO="yourusername/yourimage"
IMAGE_NAME="dind"
./${IMAGE_NAME}/.publish.sh "${DH_REPO}:${IMAGE_NAME}"
```

Each directory and type of image has its own publish script because of the different ways they are versioned.
